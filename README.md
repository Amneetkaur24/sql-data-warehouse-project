This project follows a modern layered architecture inspired by the Medallion approach:

🥉 Bronze Layer – Raw Data

Stores raw data extracted directly from source systems.

ERP and CRM data are imported from CSV files into SQL Server.

No transformations are applied at this stage.

🥈 Silver Layer – Cleaned & Transformed Data

Data cleansing and validation.

Standardization and normalization.

Resolves data quality issues before analytics.

🥇 Gold Layer – Business-Ready Data

Data modeled into a star schema.

Fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.

Designed for reporting and business insights.

📖 Project Overview

This project includes:

Data Architecture Design – Building a structured and scalable data warehouse.

ETL Development – Extracting, transforming, and loading ERP & CRM data.

Data Modeling – Creating fact and dimension tables for analytics.

SQL Analytics & Reporting – Generating business insights using SQL queries.

🎯 Project Objectives
1️⃣ Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

Objective:
Develop a modern SQL Server data warehouse that consolidates sales data for analytical reporting and decision-making.

Specifications:

Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.

Clean and resolve data quality issues.

Integrate both sources into a unified analytical model.

Focus only on the latest dataset (no historical tracking required).

Document the data model clearly for business and technical users.

2️⃣ BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analytics)

Objective:
Develop SQL-based analytics to generate insights into:

Customer Behavior

Product Performance

Sales Trends

These insights provide stakeholders with key business metrics to support strategic decisions.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

SQL Server Express

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

CSV Data Sources (ERP & CRM)

Draw.io (Architecture & Data Modeling)

Git & GitHub
